--4. Using the fielding table, group players into three groups based on their position: label players with position OF as "Outfield", those with position "SS", "1B", "2B", and "3B" as "Infield", and those with position "P" or "C" as "Battery". Determine the number of putouts made by each of these three groups in 2016.

SELECT
	CASE
		WHEN pos= 'OF' THEN 'Outfield'
		WHEN pos IN ('SS', '1B', '2B', '3B') THEN 'Infield'
		WHEN pos IN ('P', 'C') THEN 'Battery'
		END AS position,
		SUM(po) AS Putouts
	FROM fielding
	INNER JOIN people
	USING (playerid)
	WHERE fielding.yearid = '2016'
	GROUP BY position
	ORDER BY putouts DESC;

--Answer infield 58934, Battery 41424 and Outfield 29560

SELECT yearid,SUM(po) as total_po,
  CASE
    WHEN pos IN ('SS', '1B', '2B', '3B') THEN 'Infield'
    WHEN pos IN ('P', 'C') THEN 'Battery'

END AS player_group
FROM fielding
WHERE yearID = 2016
GROUP BY yearid,pos 
ORDER BY total_po 
  

--5. Find the average number of strikeouts per game by decade since 1920. Round the numbers you report to 2 decimal places. Do the same for home runs per game. Do you see any trends?

-- Find the average number of strikeouts per game by decade

SELECT(yearid/10)*10 AS decade,
ROUND (AVG(SO/G),2) AS AVG_strikeouts_per_game
FROM pitching
WHERE yearid >=1920
GROUP BY decade
ORDER BY AVG_strikeouts_per_game;


--Find average number of homeruns per game by decade

SELECT(yearid/10)*10 AS decade,
ROUND (AVG(HR/G),2) AS AVG_homeruns_per_game
FROM pitching
WHERE yearid >=1920
GROUP BY decade
ORDER BY AVG_homeruns_per_game;

--6. Find the player who had the most success stealing bases in 2016, where __success__ is measured as the percentage of stolen base attempts which are successful. (A stolen base attempt results either in a stolen base or being caught stealing.) Consider only players who attempted _at least_ 20 stolen bases.

SELECT playerid, namefirst, namelast, (sb*100)/sum(sb+cs) AS sbs
FROM batting
LEFT JOIN people
USING (playerid)
WHERE (sb+cs)>= 20 AND yearid= 2016
GROUP BY batting.playerid, people.namefirst, people.namelast, batting.sb
ORDER BY sbs DESC;

--7.  From 1970 â€“ 2016, what is the largest number of wins for a team that did not win the world series? What is the smallest number of wins for a team that did win the world series? Doing this will probably result in an unusually small number of wins for a world series champion â€“ determine why this is the case. Then redo your query, excluding the problem year. How often from 1970 â€“ 2016 was it the case that a team with the most wins also won the world series? What percentage of the time?


SELECT name, yearID,WSWin,SUM(W) as wins, SUM (L) as losses
FROM Teams 
WHERE yearID >=1970 AND yearID ='1981' AND WSWin= 'Y'
GROUP BY name, yearID, WSwin
ORDER BY wins DESC;

--answer: LA Dodgers 63 wins 47 losses

SELECT name, yearID,WSWin,SUM(W) as wins, SUM (L) as losses
FROM Teams 
WHERE yearID >=1970 AND yearID ='1981' AND WSWin= 'N'
GROUP BY name, yearID, WSwin
ORDER BY wins ASC;

--answer:  Toronto Blue Jays 37 wins and 69 losses

--8. Using the attendance figures from the homegames table, find the teams and parks which had the top 5 average attendance per game in 2016 (where average attendance is defined as total attendance divided by number of games). Only consider parks where there were at least 10 games played. Report the park name, team name, and average attendance. Repeat for the lowest 5 average attendance.


--9. Which managers have won the TSN Manager of the Year award in both the National League (NL) and the American League (AL)? Give their full name and the teams that they were managing when they won the award.

**Open-ended questions**

--11. Is there any correlation between number of wins and team salary? Use data from 2000 and later to answer this question. As you do this analysis, keep in mind that salaries across the whole league tend to increase together, so you may want to look on a year-by-year basis.

--12. In this question, you will explore the connection between number of wins and attendance.
    <ol type="a">
      <li>Does there appear to be any correlation between attendance at home games and number of wins? </li>
      <li>Do teams that win the world series see a boost in attendance the following year? What about teams that made the playoffs? Making the playoffs means either being a division winner or a wild card winner.</li>
    </ol>


--13. It is thought that since left-handed pitchers are more rare, causing batters to face them less often, that they are more effective. Investigate this claim and present evidence to either support or dispute this claim. First, determine just how rare left-handed pitchers are compared with right-handed pitchers. Are left-handed pitchers more likely to win the Cy Young Award? Are they more likely to make it into the hall of fame?
